# DTSA-5511_Week5
Week 6 Final Project for DTSA-5511

This is a project experimenting with autoencoders and applying them to the Kaggle [Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud) dataset to detect fraudulent credit card transactions.  

Unfortunately, the dataset is too large to be uploaded to GitHub, but it can be [downloaded from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud/download?datasetVersionNumber=3).
