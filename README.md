# DTSA-5511_Final
Week 6 Final Project for DTSA-5511

This is a project experimenting with autoencoders and applying them to the Kaggle [Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud) dataset to detect fraudulent credit card transactions.  

Unfortunately, the dataset is too large to be uploaded to GitHub, but it can be [downloaded from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud/download?datasetVersionNumber=3).

The final model trained with the [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/clayv/DTSA-5511_Final/blob/main/CreditCardFraud.ipynb) can be found in this repository in the [Models folder](https://github.com/clayv/DTSA-5511_Final/tree/main/Models).
